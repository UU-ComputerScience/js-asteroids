Type information seems to be lost in the conversion from HS to JS? An Int and a
String should produce separate messages, but both are seen as an object, which
should produce yet another message!


Ah, this seems to be due to the fact that the myVar from the HS world is
encapsulated by a JS object. When writing JS functions, we apparently
explicitly need to ask for the value? This seems rather strange to me. How will
we then interface with existing libraries?
